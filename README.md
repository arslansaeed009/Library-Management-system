# Library-Management-system

## Features
- **Add Books:** Allows the addition of new books to the library.
- **Display Books:** Shows all available books in the library.
- **Issue Books:** Issues books to registered users.
- **Return Books:**  Manages the return of issued books.
- **Add Users:** Allows the addition of new users to the system.
- **Display Users:** Shows all registered users in the library.

  ## Technologies Used
- **C++:** The project is entirely developed using the C++ programming language.
  ## Getting Started
  # Prerequisites
 - **A C++ compiler (like GCC, Clang, or MSVC).**
- **A development environment (like Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or any IDE of your choice).**
## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```sh
    cd library-management-system
3. Compile the source code.
    ```sh
    g++ library_management_system.cpp -o library_management_system
4. Run the executable.
    ```sh
    ./library_management_system
     ```
## Usage
- **Run the program and follow the on-screen menu to perform various operations.**
- **Choose the appropriate option from the menu to add books, display books, issue books, return books, add users, or display users.**
## How It Works
- **The current implementation does not use a database, so all data is lost when the program exits.**
- **The number of books and users is limited by the defined maximum (MAX_BOOKS and MAX_USERS).**
## Future Enhancements
- **Implement data persistence using file handling.**
- **Add a graphical user interface (GUI).**
- **Enhance the search and sorting functionality for books and users.**
